
Stub:-

A stub is a fake class that comes with preprogrammed return values. 
It's injected into the class under test to give you absolute control over what's being tested as input. 
A typical stub is a database connection that allows you to mimic any scenario without having a real database.

Stub is nothing but a class which returns a dummy data.

mock:-

A Mock is very dynamic, not hard-coded

Mock method is defined in Mockito class
you can mock a class or an interface
Mock creates mock object for the class or interface which is passed as parameter.

when() is used to stub the method and
thenReturn() sets a return value to be returned when the method is called

Using stubbing we train the mock objects about what values to return when its methods are invoked. Mockito provides when–then stubbing pattern to stub a mock object’s method invocation. 

The mock API invocation goes into when() which is a static Mockito API method and the value that we want the want the mock to return goes into the then() API.
